**Waldhari.Core** is the core library for the *Waldhari* suite of mods.  
It provides reusable and extensible services that simplify persistence and logging across multiple mods, while following clean architecture principles (interfaces, modular implementations, unit testing).

## ‚ú® Features

* **Persistence Service**
    * Interface-based (`IPersistenceService`)
    * XML implementation (`XmlPersistenceService`) using `System.Xml.Serialization`
    * Safe file operations with error handling
    * Easily extendable to support other formats (JSON, database, etc.)

* **Logging Service**
    * Interface-based (`ILogService`)
    * Tab-separated value (TSV) logs (`TsvLogService`)
        * Human-readable in Notepad
        * Easily importable into Excel for filtering and analysis
    * Supports multiple log levels: `Debug`, `Info`, `Warn`, `Error`
    * Thread-safe file writing

* **Unit Testing**
    * Comprehensive NUnit test suite
    * High code coverage, including nominal and edge cases
    * Automatic cleanup after test execution

## üöÄ Usage

### Persistence

```csharp
using Waldhari.Core.Persistence;

// Create the persistence service (default = XML)
IPersistenceService persistence = new XmlPersistenceService();

// Save data
var character = new Character { Name = "John", Rank = "Officer" };
persistence.Save("character", character);

// Load data
var loaded = persistence.Load<Character>("character");
```

### Logging

```csharp
using Waldhari.Core.Logging;

// Create a logger (default log file = scripts/Waldhari/<ModName>.log)
ILogService logger = new TsvLogService("MyMod");

// Log messages
logger.Debug("This is a debug message");
logger.Info("Game started");
logger.Warn("Low health detected");
logger.Error("An error occurred", new Exception("Something went wrong"));
```

The log file will be written under:
```
<GTAV Directory>/scripts/Waldhari/<ModName>.log
```

Example TSV line:
```
2025-09-06 14:20:01.123   Info    "Game started"   ""
```

## üîÆ Roadmap

* Configurable log file rotation
* Management of localization files
